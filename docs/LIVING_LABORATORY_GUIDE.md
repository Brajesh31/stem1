## üåç Philosophy: The Environment as the Laboratory

### Core Principles

1. **Hyperlocal Learning**: Every village, every environment contains rich scientific phenomena waiting to be explored
2. **Citizen Science**: Students become active contributors to real scientific research, not just consumers of knowledge
3. **Frugal Innovation**: Constraints spark creativity - limited resources lead to ingenious solutions
4. **Community Impact**: Learning has immediate, measurable benefits for the local community
5. **Peer Knowledge Creation**: Students learn from and teach each other through shared discoveries

### Educational Transformation

Traditional STEM education often presents science as abstract concepts disconnected from daily life. The Living Laboratory module reverses this by:

- Making the local environment the primary source of learning material
- Connecting every scientific concept to observable phenomena in students' surroundings
- Empowering students to contribute to actual scientific knowledge
- Fostering innovation mindset through real problem-solving
- Building a community of young scientists and innovators
